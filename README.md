This application is being developed for R&D purposes only to identify a certain application(s), I do not want people to uninstall any of the application(s) they are using currently. 

Installed application is not using any private APIs. Based on the prefilled app data it tries to identify the application(s) installed on the device.

I do not guarantee for any correct/wrong information, so users should act only at their own will.  Our application detects and shows the installed application name, icon and the seller.
